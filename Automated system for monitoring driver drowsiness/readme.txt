Driver Drowsiness Detection

−The aim of the project was to detect the drowsiness of candidates while driving vehicles, operating machinery, and various others operations.

−The system successfully detected drowsiness when the candidate closes their eyes with beep sound and emergency alert system to inform dearest ones, ignoring the immediate blink. I have used OpenCV and Deep Learning concepts for this project.
